[Analyzing Traffic Sources](#Analyzing_Traffic_Sources)
<p>Traffic Source Analysis

<li>Understanding where the customers are coming from and which channels are driving the highest quality traffic.</li>
<li>Typically, traffic sources are email, social media, search engine, and direct traffic.</li>
<li>Looking at conversion rate (CVR) which is the percentage of the traffic that converts into sales or revenue activity.</li> </p>

<p>Why is it important to conduct Conversion Rate Analysis?

<li>Shift budget towards search engines, campaigns, or keywords driving the highest conversion rate.</li>
<li>Compare user behaviour across traffic sources to customize messaging strategy.</li>
<li>Identify opportunities to eliminate paid marketing channel or scale performing traffic.</li> </P>

<p>In this section, we will learn about
<li>Analyzing top traffic source</li>
<li>Bid optimization and trend analysis<li>
</p>

<li>Stakeholder (ST)'s request: Breakdown of sessions by UTM source, campaign and referring domain up to 12-04-2012</li>
<li>Results: utm_source | utm_campaign | http_referer | sessions (count)</li>
<li>Steps: Filter results up to sessions before '2012-04-12' and group results by utm_source, utm_campaign and http_referer</li>

<p> Insights </P>

<li>Drill deeper into gsearch nonbrand campaign traffic to explore potential optimization opportunities</li>

<li>ST request: Calculate CVR from session to order. If CVR is 4% >=, then increase bids to drive volume, otherwise reduce bids.</li>
<li>Results: sessions (count) | orders (count) | conversion rate</li>
<li>Steps: Filter sessions < 2012-04-12, utm_source = gsearch and utm_campaign = nonbrand</li>

  <br>
  <p>Insights: Conversion rate is 2.92%, which is less than 4%, hence we're overspending on gsearch nonbrand campaign and have to reduce bids. To monitor impact of bid reduction for the campaign.</p>
  
  # Bid Optimization & Trend Analysis
  <p>Analysing for bid optimization is understanding the value of various segments of paid traffic to optimize marketing budget.</p>
 <li> Our job is to figure out the right amount of bid for various segments of traffic based on our potential revenue.</li>
<ul>How do we do that?
  <li>Use conversion rate and revenue per click to figure out how much you should spend per click to acquire customers.</li>
  <li>Understand how website and products are performing for subsegments of traffic to optimise within channels.</li>
  <li>Analyse impact of bid changes have on ranking</li>
</ul>
